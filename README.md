This repository contains resources for **"Stop Implementing AI"** - a practical guide to structured AI-assisted development using the PIT™ (Plan, Implement, Test) methodology.

## About the Book

**Stop Implementing AI** teaches engineering teams how to transform unpredictable AI outputs into reliable, production-ready code. The methodology has delivered measurable results: 85% time reduction, 82% cost savings, and developers increasing from 1-2 pull requests per day to 5-10.

## Repository Contents

### 📝 Example Prompts (`stop-implementing-ai/`)

All example prompts from the book, organized by chapter. These prompts demonstrate the PIT™ methodology and can be copied directly into your AI-powered IDE.

See the [stop-implementing-ai README](stop-implementing-ai/README.md) for details and chapter links.

### 🤖 Custom Commands (`cursor/commands/`)

Ready-to-use custom commands for **Cursor** and **Claude Code** that implement the PIT™ methodology. These commands can be installed in your IDE to standardize AI-assisted development workflows.

Available commands:
- `create_plan.md` - Create detailed implementation plans
- `implement_plan.md` - Implement phases from a plan
- `research.md` - Research codebases systematically
- `validate_plan.md` - Review and validate plans
- `test_coverage.md` - Analyze test coverage
- `run_tests.md` - Execute and validate tests
- `analyze_pull_request.md` - Analyze pull requests
- `create_git_commit.md` - Create structured git commits
- `pull_request.md` - Generate pull request descriptions

**How to Use:**
1. Copy the command files to your IDE's commands directory:
   - **Cursor**: `.cursor/commands/` in your workspace root
   - **Claude Code**: `.claude/commands/` in your workspace root
2. Restart your IDE
3. Use the commands with `/` prefix (e.g., `/create_plan`)

# Stop Implementing AI - Example Prompts

This repository contains all the example prompts from the book **"Stop Implementing AI"** organized by chapter. These prompts demonstrate the PIT™ (Plan, Implement, Test) methodology for AI-assisted software development.

## About the Book

**Stop Implementing AI** is a practical guide to structured AI-assisted development that transforms unpredictable AI outputs into reliable, production-ready code. The book teaches the PIT™ method, a repeatable process that helps engineering teams:

- Plan with detailed specifications before coding
- Implement in small, manageable phases
- Test comprehensively using Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The methodology has delivered measurable results: 85% time reduction, 82% cost savings, and developers increasing from 1-2 pull requests per day to 5-10.
